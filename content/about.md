# Hi there

Hey, I'm Arif! I'm a developer freelance from Indonesia. This is my spot on the web for projects I've created, blog I've written, and anything else I want to show to you.

I love learning something new and to create useful and effective tools with code which can help other do work.

I'm human too and forgetful, so instead of my brain lost old material when i start learn something new, i decide to document it.
